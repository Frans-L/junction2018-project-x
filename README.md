Find free parking spots by using machine learning and cameras that are embedded into public transports. Busses and trams are constantly roaming around the city, providing excellent coverage for the city centre area. Simple dash cams record the street side of roads and with the help of machine learning algorithms, data provided by third parties and the city of Tampere, we can determine where are free parking spots by computer vision and external data.

Users can find free parking spots easily by our website http://trepark.live . There is navigation to closest free parking spot and real time updating map view that updates whenever a camera is on the move. Current demo environment with full functionality can be found in Otaniemi with live camera demo at our booth, also Tampere is modelled and operation ready, waiting for camera deployment in the actual Tampere region.
 
We hope for our project to serve citizens of Tampere to find their parking spot the best they can in the heart of the city. Stress free, without rush, and hassle free.
